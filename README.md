## Why Mirrored Colemak?
There are many benefits of one handed typing, for example, you can be more efficient by keeping one hand on the mouse and the other takes care of the keyboard.  
You can also have a drink in one hand and still be able to type your favorite text with one hand.

## How Hard is It?
It should be pretty easy to learn and adapt a mirrored keyboard layout since your brain already knows where the keys are and you just need to get used to the modifier button.
Of course, there will be a learning curve, especially if you are not proficient in touch typing.

## How Does it Work?
Basically, a mirrored layout maps two characters on the keyboard on one key based on their positions. For example, in a QWERTY layout, the `j` and `f` are the places the index finger lays. In a `mirrored QWERTY` layout, the `f` key would become a `j` if the space bar is held down when pressing the key.
So, all in all, the character you want to input will still be typed by the same finger on the same relative position but done all by one hand.

## How is KeyOne Configured?
KeyOne is a AutoHotKey Script that makes the space bar a modifier key if it's pressed down alongside with another key. However, the script is already compiled into an `.exe` executable for Windows users.
If you would like to modify the script, you are welcome to do so since the source file is included as well.

## How Do I Use It?
Upon running the program, the mirrored Colemak keyboard will start automatically. Keep in mind, the Colemak keyboard layout should be already installed and selected in order to work. 
Now, you can try and press buttons on the left half of the keyboard and try pressing the same key but with the space bar held down. You will realize it is already mirrored.   
To pause or suspend the script, you just need to press `ctl+space` and press again to resume. If you like, you could also add the `.exe` to your startup folder so it's enabled by default.

## Future Improvements
Now, this script is only written for the left hand only. The right side could be done easily using AutoHotKey, but since I only use my left to type, I didn't bother to spend more time.  
Of course, is you would like to use your right hand, you can always add that part and submit it as a pull request.
